Tests are failing because I havent set up the workflows properly

git clone this repo, then run npm install then run npx playwright test 

you can run this for API tests for the timebeing
```
npx playwright run api
```

TODO
// add docs
// Finish up API tests
// Create custom playwright worker to run tests
// Improve code reusability and single code function
// The UI tests can be refractored into different navigation
